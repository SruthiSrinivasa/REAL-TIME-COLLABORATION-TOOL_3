# Real-Time Collaborative Editor
Develop a real-time collaborative tool for coding or note-taking, similar to Google Docs, using WebSockets for instant updates. This allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously.

# 🔹 How It Works
1️⃣ User A and User B open the same document
2️⃣ When User A types, the text is sent to the WebSocket server
3️⃣ The server broadcasts the update to all connected users
4️⃣ User B's screen updates instantly with the new content

Core Feature: Real-time synchronization using WebSockets
