# Real-Time Collaborative Editor
Develop a real-time collaborative tool for coding or note-taking, similar to Google Docs, using WebSockets for instant updates. This allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously.

# üîπ How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ User A and User B open the same document
2Ô∏è‚É£ When User A types, the text is sent to the WebSocket server
